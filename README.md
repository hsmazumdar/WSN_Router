A Novel Energy Efficient Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become integral to various applications, necessitating energy-efficient strategies to extend their lifespan. This algorithm addresses the challenge of limited energy availability in wireless sensor nodes, which is particularly critical in applications where direct human intervention is impractical. A novel routing strategy involving both mobile and static sinks is proposed that optimizes retransmissions and puts low battery powered nodes in sleep.
